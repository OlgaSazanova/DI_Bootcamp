# Project is working, made with tkinter. Code is clean and works fine. Connection to DB clear and correct. 
# You also practiced modules, classes which is very good. Since in your Report class some methods don't require any self, you could use @staticmethod decorator. 
# I think this import might also be a bit confusing:

# import tkinter as tk
# from tkinter import messagebox

# If your code will be long enough it might looks like the messagebox you used is some kind of module itself and not a part of tk.
